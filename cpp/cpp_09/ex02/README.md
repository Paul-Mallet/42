# ex02 - PmergeMe

Lester Ford - Selmer Johnson algorithm,
Merge-Insert sort O(n log (n)) with O(log n) division * O(n) merge,
Less comparisons as possible,
Great for large datasets,
Preserve order using Pair Recursion,
Binary Search with std::lower_bound(),
Straggler Odd number, pair, pairs of pairs, last one part...,
Main elements , and Pend for pending elements
Jacobsthal Numbers Sequence (insertion),
Positive int sequence,
Sequence Containers

1. Args as positive int array(resized)
2. Binary search (/2) intarr recursively until having 1 elem arrays.
3. 

## How to run ?

```bash
	make
	make doc
	make test
	make debug
	make clean
	make fclean
	make re
```

## std::vector & std::deque

The 1rst sequence container used for this purpose was the **std::vector**.

WHY ?
* Dynamic resize.
* 

The 2nd one was the **std::deque**.

WHY ?
* Dynamic resize.
* 

Those 2 where used to clearly see the difference between each other in Time Complexity with a high amount of numbers to sort.
